# Usage

The easiest way to change the file being displayed is to change `book.txt` by copy and pasting your own text in it.

To run the code, you will need the Processing library for Java installed, which can be found at: https://processing.org/download.

This project was made as an assignment for my computer science class - you may use my code however you like, freely.
